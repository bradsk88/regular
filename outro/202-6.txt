  Another Ford Focus is kinda nice But the Fords I like are the Fords like mine When you're catchin' hell Ford puts someone to love it anyway, anyway But what kind of person needs self esteem When you just purchased a Focus to fulfill your dream You don't need another person just to tell you that your car's okay "Oy" in Spanish means "today"

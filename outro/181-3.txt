  Also to the tune of GASTON from DISNEY'S BEAUTY AND THE BEAST:    Nothing    Drives like Corvette    Or quite thrives like Corvette    Nothing draws an obnoxious white crowd like Corvette    It has optimum weight distribution    So it's stiff as a good morning chub    You can ask any red blooded human    And they'll tell you that C5 is better than drugs

  (Backup vocals:) Oooh he's drunk drunk, oooh he's drunk drunk This little car is just "okay" If you like crumpets and Ben Gay A cloud that has a silver lining Well, that's kinda still a cloud Direct injection engine sound Quiet as Sunday church and farts But God keeps helpin' anyway And he can still judge you for this car I want to try this Malibu Right through this broside fall I'm angsty and I'm seventeen And hey I made it all (?) (Oooh he's drunk drunk, oooh he's drunk drunk)

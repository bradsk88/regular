  to the tune of LEARN TO FLY by FOO FIGHTERS I'm lookin' at a Piper Cherokee I'm lookin' at a Archer II This parody's too obvious to do This plane, it has a flat-four engine Does 180 when it's in nosedive Now will you excuse me while I fist the sky Now will you excuse me while I fist the sky

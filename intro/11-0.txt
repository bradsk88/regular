[Intro by Mr. Regular, read in an excited "radio DJ" voice] Hey hey! Welcome back to 98.3 FM, the BEER BELLY. We've got Hawaiian shirts, Bud Light in a beer coozie, "Cheeseburger in Paradise" coming up at the top of the hour, and we're giving away a Lincoln TOWN CAR! [Intro Song: "What Are Friends For?" by Reel Big Fish.]

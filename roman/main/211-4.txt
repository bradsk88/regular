 Thank you, Roman. When we had this thing up in Centralia, folks loved it. The offroad guys were magnetically pulled to this idea of triumphant individualism because that's what post-apocalyptic movies are about, they're very much Westerns. It's the idea of the individual triumphing over nature or some barbaric tribe. And the cars have become the horse. The faithful, rugged steed. And that's what this represents. Because all of us- eh, maybe it's a male thing or maybe it's an American thing - we love this romantic vision of us standing tall against a pile of evil in a wasteland. What is it about that? And even though this car is horrific to drive, and you also have to- you can get into the back seats of this car but you have to pull some pins and take this fake roll cage- oh yeah, this roll cage. It's welded directly to the body. Oh, and another thing, these red lights facing forward? They're illegal. The little blue lights flashing inside this whatever-this-thing-is? That's illegal. I don't think the chicken wire inside the windows is illegal though. Anyway. This car is very good at doing one thing: representing individualistic survivability. It's representing an idea. And it's wonderful at stayin' put. Just don't drive it.

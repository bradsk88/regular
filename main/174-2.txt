one thing about the Loyale? No rev limiter! None. Y-y-you can rev this until the engine explodes. First and second gear are your go-gears and by fifth gear at 57 miles an hour, you're pulling about 3000 rpms.  And this is back when Subarus *did* go offroad. The Loyale turned Subaru from that weird car company to "dat's a good car!" And this is what made people appreciate Subaru. In most of Pennsylvania, you can still see old Loyales rolling around as mail trucks. "Oh, they work in all weather!" It w-wasn't until the Subaru RS that Subaru became weird again in North America, I mean, we knew of other weird stuff in the nineties about Subaru because of Gran Turismo and all that, but for most of the nineties, *this* was Subaru. The Subaru Loyale is a car, and that's the most generous thing you can really say about it. It's the four-wheel equivalent of a dad who doesn't just drop his daughter off at the concert, he stays with her throughout the entire show on the off-chance she gets invited backstage to play HIDE THE MASTER SWORD with JOHNNY FROSTED TIPS {"Hey now, you're an AllStar" appears on-screen momentarily}. Of course, a car shouldn't be put down just because it isn't fun to drive. Plenty of cars are reliable without having to be fun, but one you're inside, it's like, "who is this even for?" I know we've been over this, but who is the target audience for this? The target audience was everybody. It breaks down like this: If the Subaru Loyale was a movie, it'd be the Superman Returns of cars. It's a conservative product that takes no risks. It's good, but completely unremarkable in just about every way. I know that spare tire's under the hood, and that's sort of a BRAT thing, oh, and there's one other thing

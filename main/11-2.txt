  That's it. That's it? No, that's it. Just 210. A '94 Evo 1 will make 240 horsepower out of a 2 liter 4-cylinder with a hairdryer. That's the point, kid. A Town Car spends its entire life barely cracking 2100 RPM. All you holier-than-thou Volvo owners in Ithica boast that your 240 has gone 300,000 miles. So? This body-on-frame boat will go 100 grand further than that. It's all down to a DE-tuned engine. Oh sure, the Modular V8 could make more; there's plenty of room for tuning. But 210 horsepower, that adequate. That's enough. See, this engine is like Larry Bird. He's out loping around the court while you're spinning your wheels, and then he's gonna outwork your entire D at the buzzer. While your Swedish brick is out there banging and rattling around the hills, this Lincoln runs quietly and noiselessly, cradling you in serene comfort.  ["Stars and Stripes Forever" slowly fades into the background.] So! Mr. Britain. I love your music, I love your MG's, and I now love your chocolate biscuits. So visit, please! As much as you complain, and as much as you boast, and as much as you make fun of our big engines that don't make a lot of power... you secretly love every minute of it. You may hate our culture, but you watched Avengers twice. You may hate our burgers, but you're taking a second bite. So enjoy this mammoth vehicle. It refuses no one. It is affordable to everyone! And when all the little Peugeots, and Renaults, and Fiats, and Cavaliers, and Neons, and Mazda 626's; when all the cars break down, this ugly, unashamed, magnificent land yacht will bring all of you to safety.  This beautiful, overweight behemoth will endure.

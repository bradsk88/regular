 (FR-S) Kiiiiiiiids But modernist babblings aside, the FR-S, or BRZ if you have the dough, is the perfect car for analog stick drivers. There's no sense in getting an E36 or an AW11 which poses genuine risk and danger to the driver. Driving an E36 doped up on courage and heartache carries the same wrathful consequences as sliding on two extra 45-pound plates and going for a new personal best without a spotter. Stupid. It's stupid- why would you do that? And an AW11, well, the kids think they're epic (Caption: Over-used adjective) but I don't see any of them eager to learn how to understand a cryptic OBD1 ECU. Nope, it's best to have an FR-S. It's best to have a nerfed version of speed and cornering than go for something that becomes unmanageable. And very, very insurance deductible real. What I'm saying is this: an FR-S feels fast all the time. Yes, it's a Subaru boxter but it doesn't make the German Shepherd chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga panting sound. It goes fvvvwww because FR-Ss and BRZs have equal-length headers on either side of the pots. Pots? Snots? Knots? Dots? Rumps? Slumps? Dumps? SHEMALE PORN ADDICTION It's hard to say whether the FR-S, BRZ and for people in Australia, the 86, whatever that is, is going to be the savior everybody wanted it to be. Some people say it's the last great cheap sports car. But are these things going to be valuable in twenty years? I don't know.

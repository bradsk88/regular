 there were these dudes on Kawasaki KLR 650s with no road leathers or head buckets and their girlfriends in the back were somehow wearing less. Up in the canyons, they took every sharp corner on those scoliosis roads, braving the asphalt in flip-flops and booty shorts, one wrong turn from shredding their bodies into the consistency of pulled pork. But with the XT350, you won't wind up on the dinner menu at Smokey Bones. There's just enough power here to get you into trouble, but not enough to put a reasonably intelligent person into mortal peril. The XT350 maintains its status, even nearly 25 years on. If this bike were a person, it would be the weathered former alphamale who used to have a piss stream strong enough to push a 2 liter bottle of soda across a table. It's THAT kind of confidence, it's THAT kind of self-certainty that never ends, and it never really goes away even while the circumstances of the world change at large.

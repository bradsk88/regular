  The Focus RS is an open-minded varsity wrestler. And its Recaro seats' bolstering arms are holding me by my pelvis. And I trust him. It's... hard to move. I can't move enough to head check my blind spots. I can't move enough to look in the back seat. But it's okay. It's okay, I trust Focus RS. hold me Crank numbers! are a glorious three-fifty double. 350 horse, 350 torque. Pause for a moment and appreciate the 2.3-liter EcoBoost. Remember only two or three years ago when they put it in the Mustang and we all spoke with arms Akimbo, "I dunno, is the world going to accept a four-banger Mustang?" Never mind that they *did* accept a four-banger Mustang in the early '90s. And you can trace the 2.3-liter EcoBoost genealogy. And when you do you arrive at the 2.3-liter Lima. Yeah, that plucky single-jingle who refused to choke up on the bat and slap a safe infield grounder. No! it Kamehameha swung for the hot parking lot and took turbo boost like a champ. And the 2.3-liter Ecoboost is its grandson. Okay, over there, hey. Ford of Europeland? Hi, what's up, I'm wavin' from Jersey. A-are you getting this message? Can you feel Adam Smith's invisible hand tickling your peat bog bratwurst? We want your products. And, as over-MSRP dealer pricing at launch proved, we will pay - happily - anything to get them. So why did we have to wait for the RS for this long? Everybody in America was Oliver Twist and the Focus ST was yummy but we were all, "Please sir, may I have some more?" MORE? And then you held the RS porridge bowl over our heads for four. BLUEBALLED. YEARS. Not that we aren't grateful! Absence makes the dick grow thicker. But now it's time to drive this and please... please... live up to the Duke Nukem hype.

Harold Slovinski throughout This is the car that kids like. This is the drug that kids like. **INTRO** His names Harold Slovinski, he drives his wifes Accord, but now hes got his own fresh set of wheels he cant afford. OH yeah, you know who this is, this is your old buddy, HAROLD SLOVINSKI, and this is my new 20-mm *sniff* 2004 Honda Civic Si. Things are looking up for old Harold Slovinski, yah-eeh, I got a promotion down at the four Gs. You know how we do-herrhnngheehehheehah LOCAL DOG. I got this little sassy number to have fun on the road, givin m-givin the BUSINESS. Heh heh, givin it like I give it to my wife, hyah, MONOGAMY. What youre lookin at here is a 2004 Honda Civic Si 2-door sport hatchback. It has a 6,800 RPM redline. IM AN ENTHUSIAST NOW. I got the stick shift, I mean-I still have the Honda Accord, but yeh- its still an automatic-and thats just fine. BUT NOW I GOT THE STICK SH- I CAN FIT IN WITH YOU GUYS NOW. The stick shift- uhm see mmhhuhhng- the stick shift- this car- is not- its-its up on this DASH. I tell you what, thi- this car knows the score, the speedometer goes up 140 MPH. Its got power mirrors because BUSINESS, yeah its got Kenwood Stereo thats classy business, its got a hidden cup holders, down there-oh, oh thats for discreet business I bought this car- this is my new road trip car, my wifes at home right now. Im- a lot of time on the ROAD, and this is a l- its a light car, for light BUSINESS. The wifes at home right now, and shes- shes spendin some time at a- dont worry shes not all alone, shes spendin time with a mutual friend of ours, DAN ARNITZ. THIS IS THE SEVENTH GENERATION CIVIC Si. YEAH, SEVENTH GENERATION, KEEPIN IT IN THE FAMILY. And my wife is driving the Honda Accord primarily na- she can handle- its a car, she can use it. BAH- anyway, lets- lets go and take a look at the engine here, well have real car review. The engine is DAW THE KIDS LIKE THIS, THIS IS THE K20 A3, AND THAT MAKES 160HP, you know its not as punchy as the original VTEC, cuzyknowits i-VTEC. Not the classic version, you know the method of variable valve operation, but with the i-VTEC you get 20% more torque. It doesnt have an LSD, AND THAT STANDS FOR LIMITED SLIP DIFFERENTIAL. It doesnt have one, but thats just fine, thats just fine. But the Civic Si still goes pretty fast, an- y-ye DAN ARNITZ HAS A HONDA TOOOOO, WE GOTTA HANG OUT SOME TIME. THE TOW- I GOTTA HANG OUT WITH DAN ARNITZ, HES A SOLID GUY, GOOD FRIEND OF THE FAMILY Back to my Si, I got aftermarket wheels and y-. Thats how you know the cars good. Got lots of room in the back for everything you need to keep a Civic Si safe, goin on road trips like I do a lot. Its got independent suspension all around, thats an important thing, that means the wheels can move, on their own, up and down. This is what the kids like to call old school, it has a mechanical throttle, that means theres a cable, goin from the accelerator pedal all the way to throttle body. No unin- no unintended acceleration here. (I cant even begin to describe this noise) I have no idea what this wire does, its- it was in the engine, yknow I dont feel like messin with it. Its tough bein on the road, but I get to stay at the nice hotels, and see the local people. Im kickin it- KICKIN IT YEAH, SOUTH BEND, INDIANA. Livin it up at the Shake n Bake, at the Shake n Steak. I get to see my wife on the weekends now- they, you know the guys, the 4 Gs, they been sendin me out on the road a lot, thats just fine, I get to drive this little number all around. I- I cant tell ya how much Im enjoyin my life. I mean, things are lookin up, theyre lookin so good, yknow we got this fren- DAN ARNITZ, hes a solid guy. Honda Civic Si, that- I- didje- its really good to stay in touch with the young people. I bought this car from a guy from FRENCH INDO-CHINA. Okay, ya lee- ya young fellas, I gotta get movin down that road of life. Im talkin about- I got $40 allocated for me to dinner and Im gonna live it up with some people I met in the hot tub, were goin to Golden Corral. **OUTRO** My wifes posts have gone wild, my marriage license is on file Imma do my Civic duty, when Im comin for that booty, but Im really only talkin bout my Si Its a lot nicer than what Ill probably get, its bigger than the size of Bill Cosbys regret, its got me feelin hot as David Koresh, its calling me in Spanish, Honda Civic yes, this is a car that had to be done, got a Honda Civic, who needs a son? Has a 2-litre in-line four, 5-speed manual, 160 horse, Cold air intake, not stock wheels, College nostalgia? top notch feels, Its the perfect car for quickies in-between classes, whippin out the D be pleasin all them asses, Sure it looks like a sausage fest been cooked wrong, but she wont complain bout that 5-dollar foot-long, You want advice, what do I look like, Dan Landers? Just figure it out, Summer Sanders

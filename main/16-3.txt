 hard lines and balled-up fisted fender flares and razor-wire turn signals and mean-drunk taillights. Of course, all the headlights are frowning! But the Miata has soft edges. Its eyes are big and innocent. Its engine doesn't humblebrag. Its door sills are low, creating a feeling of openness. This is a park bench, not a prison! You see, us guys think that this [CAR WITH A PERFORMANCE EXHAUST REVVING], this [CAR DOING DONUTS], and this [MOTORCYCLE DOING A STOPPIE] creates girl-boners.

[SEXUAL MOANING OVER BLACK] [TEXT: Bad Dragon] This Miata has a limited-slip differential. Now, that was an option in '95 and you can tell who doesn't have one by all the peg-leg burnouts. See, this naturally aspirated engine is happy to tach up and down all day long AND it lasts for hundreds of thousands of miles. Everybody has to do SOMETHING to their Miata because there's so many of them, so here's whats different about this one: The seats are out of a newer Miata because they have headrests that are built right into the backs. This mirror up here is off of a Ford something; it's off of a domestic car because the only light you originally got within the Miata is way over here on the passenger side. The headlights inside the pop-up headlights are different; they're a newer design, not the old sealed beams. Hey, AUX jack! And it also has the optional air conditioning and power steering. The roof goes down in 1... 2... oh, it's down. AND this car has some tall-people mods, which is a visor delete, some foam cut out of the driver's seat, and it has pull-straps here on the door instead of the original armrests. That's to keep your knees from hitting the sides of the armrests, so pull-straps will do. Miatas are balanced, quick turning, mechanically simple, and 50-50 weight distribution. Yes, I know it doesn't make a whole lot of power

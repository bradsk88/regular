  1995 Mazda Miata. The mid 1990's was a very special time for Mazda because the Miata had no natural two-seat predators. Sure, there was the Pontiac Fiero and [the] MR2 SW-20, but those were for beaked-out mid-engine adrenaline junkies who wanted to chug Jolt cola and stare down the Grim Reaper on every rainy interstate off-ramp. The Miata, on the other hand, was for people who wanted to live long enough to eat another pair of Burger Buddies. Oooh-hoo-hoo! Huh-huh. Heh. Headlights go up! Heh-eh. Headlights go down! Mmm-hmm.

And it worked! You COULD own a Miata as your only vehicle. Did you know one of the Miata's early designs was FRONT-wheel drive? Yeah, there was also a mid-engine rear-wheel drive. And it took years for them to convince, "No, you have to have it FRONT-engined REAR-wheel drive." And did you know that the Miata is also the only sports car that works on girls? Yep. No, yeah. Nice guys, listen up. Put that fedora back on the rack at Turkey Hill, put your Genesis collection up on eBay, and start saving your laundry quarters for a Miata. Here's how it works: All other two-seat sports cars are aggressive

- Regular (Narrating); What on earth are we doing? Why are we doing? We don't belong in this car. I don't belong in this car. This is a 2012 Aston Martin V8 Vantage Roadster. This is a car that costs as much as a house. This car costs as much as a ranch on one acre of land where I come from, and it's slower than a Corvette C7. Look, I get it, this isn't a regular car. At all. It's not the economy shoe boxes we usually review, but nor is this anything we'd ever hope to use as a daily driver. But here's the thing, even in a parking lot full of Tacomas, C3s, and Sunfires, this Aston never got a second look. Throughout our entire time in Toledo, not a single head turned. Alright, ONE person knew what this was. One person. We were out here for 3 hours, one person knew this was a Vantage. Even in the presence of lesser cars, Raph Orlove's Baja Bug elicited more interesting stares and smiles than this, but here's the experience we took away from driving this. (Camera Mic, cutting to Regular on the toilet) UGGGHHH, WHY TO PEOPLE BUY ASTONS? MY ASS IS BLASTING. UGH I HAVE TO SPREAD THE WORD OF THIS COLOSSAL TURD. OH IT FEELS SO WRONG, THAT'S WHY I'M CALLING BLAKE.  *phone rings* Blake Z. Rong: Hello? Regular: MY PENIS WON THE POPULAR VOTE. I CAN'T GET INTO CONGRESS. WHY DON'T THE KIDS SMILE AT ME? I'M TRYING MY BEST AS I DRIVE PAST. MY CAN, I, UGH. MY CAT HAS TWO VAGINAS. I DON'T KNOW WHERE THIS POOP IS GOING. I PUT A SMALL TRANSISTOR ON IT, AND IT WENT TO HERBERT HOOVER'S NATIONAL MUSEUM. PEPSIDENT IS MY PREFERRED... TOILET PAPER. I... COMPLETE CARE, COMPLETE PROTECTION FOR STRONG ENAMEL, AND HEALTHY GUMS AND IT WHITENS TEETH AND IT STRENGTHENS MY CONFIDENCE WITH ART MAJORS.  (Narration) Driving an Aston Martin is like wrapping yourself in the king's cloak; for those who know, they know you're up to something good. When I was driving this car it felt like I was a more important ant to the rest of this collective ant hill. An Aston Martin fills you with a real sense of purpose. When I drove this car, it felt like I mattered. It felt like I mattered in the way the owner of this car matters.  The owner of this car has a great story. He went to school for computer programming or some such major, and he figured out he knew more than his professors. So he left school, started his own company, and within three years he's turning a healthy profit and he bought this car for cash. And you know what he does with it? He autocrosses it. Yeah, he shows up right next to all the Miatas and everyone in their Ford.. uh, PROBES, and he goes "Hi, guys, I'd like to race with you today!" Heh, and he just burns the tires off this thing because he can. Wouldn't you? Yeah, it's a high end luxury vehicle, but Aston Martins welcome being uninterested. And that's the interesting thing, I'm not sure many other luxury cars can be this inconspicuous. You can almost understand why they chose this to be the car of that spy from England no one remembers. With that said, we got over our sense of awe pretty quickly, and I imagine an Aston Martin owner and his reverence are just as easily parted. Reverence can be good if it translates into dedication and attentiveness, like it does with Corvette owners. But having stars in your eyes over a car you're not pouring yourself into is about as useful as emotions on a RealDoll. OR AND ODOR FUNCTION ON A FLESHLIGHT. Post-2008 Aston models like this one come with a 4.7 liter V8 engine making 420 horsepower. The 7 speed automated manual transmission was a nice surprise, even though this doesn't boast the same level of performance as other cars in its class. Again, the C7. But the exhaust has this musical quality to it. It's not harsh like a tuner car. It doesn;t reanimate Reagan like a C7. It simply says "I'm off." (Camera Audio)  *Regular drives car, revs engine, laughs* Oh that would've been something I could've u- (Narration) Drop the top and listen to it sing while you're out there. It's like "Scenes From an Italian Restaurant" being sung with earnest. That said, we were kind of disappointed by the exterior. I mean, yes, it's very pretty. It's not striking, and maybe that's me as an American wanting something a little bit shouty, like the C7. It's easy to see why people look at this car and go "Oh, I didn't know the Ford Fusion came as a convertible." The V8 Vantage is like clicking on a pretty girl's profile picture, only to meet her and find out she was just having a great hair day. Sure, she's still pretty, but not that pretty that was promised. But, even with an underwhelming aesthetic, the car still gives off a pervasive aura of worldliness.  (Camera Audio) These are magnetic. The little strap that hold the seat belt to the seat is a magnetic clasp. (Narration) Aston Martins are the official cars of wind blown hair an Baltika No. 9. How to I pronounce that? Balk-ta. Bal-tik-a. NUMBER 9.  Get behind the wheel of an Aston Martin and suddenly you become a person who has no use for anything but the finer things. Just kidding, we went to Outback Steakhouse after this shoot. I FARTED A LOT.  The V8 Vantage Roadster is for the man who sees eating pussy as business AND PLEASURE. He'll get in trouble with Johnny Law, but he'll find a way out, because he always does.  The 2012 Aston Martin V8 Vantage, the official car of "I'm sure we can settle this out of court."

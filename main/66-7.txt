the Aspen failed. This almost bankrupted Chrysler. It failed hard. It failed completely. In its own time, it was a bomb not seen since the Manhattan Project. This thing failed harder than Smith & Wesson mountain bikes, Life Savers soda, Coors Rocky Mountain spring water, Sony Betamax, the XFL. It failed harder than the presidency of William Henry Harrison, or the first assassination attempt on Archduke Franz Ferdinand, a man whom fate demanded to be killed. [Caption: "Seriously, it's a crazy-ass story."] Its status as a recall nightmare was mostly due to early body rust and some generally poor construction under the hood. The recalls were for everything from emission control systems to seatbelt retractors. However, the Aspen was still touted as "the family car of the future" with its big comfort and relatively low cost. One of the things the Aspen can do is sit six people. This is one thing, thanks to safety regulations, we will never see again

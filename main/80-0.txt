Mr Regular: This is a Honda S2000 from the year 2000. This is from a year that was still technically the 90's but in name only, because only in the 2000's were we, as a society, still willing to put up with smash mouth, and 9th grade girls who are turning in their portfolio for art class, and it's filled with nothing but Sephiroth fan art.

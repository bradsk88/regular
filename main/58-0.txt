[Note: It's spelled, "ForTwo" not "FourTwo".] 2009 Smart ForTwo. Driving a Smart car is like whipping out Marmite every day at lunch and scooping spoonfuls of it on store brand whole wheat and announcing to the entire cafeteria, "I enjoy this!" AWW MAN, I LOVE IT. OH, I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS. I LOVE REVOLTING, EXPENSIVE PRODUCTS SOLD IN SMALL PORTIONS TO NICHE MARKETS.

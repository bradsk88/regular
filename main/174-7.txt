they had the Subaru wagon in the nineties and have bought nothing but these cars since.  So you don't get your crazy WRXs and you don't get your STIs without this big steady base of customers who are just buying your oatmeal cars.

The Roman: {to the tune of Green Day's F.O.D.} I'm feeling fairly bold, this car is very old, the Subaru Loyale. A dad joke on four wheels, deliverance of feels, a daughter all grown up. Let's drive this car that we have never drove before, pretend that Subaru is Ford. And with this car, we'll change like we are Alex Mack, and these reviews are finally back.

  The Honda Del Sol was a colostomy bag replacement for the CRX. It has a ghetto surgery butt that looks like an MR2 style mid-mounted engine would go in there but nope. It's nothin' but a front-engine, front-wheel drive for family fun. Ehhhhh. But. The Del Sol is better made than the CRX. The interior trim pieces don't feel chintzy like dollar store squirt guns. Better equipped, too, than the USDM CRX. Power windows. Power *rear* window. The Del Sol's targa tops are dual function car roofs and lie detectors because every Del Sol targa top forms imperfect seals. I'm serious. These things leaked on the showroom floor. Listen, anybody who tells you that their Del Sol targa top doesn't leak is lying through his Dirt Mall dentures. See, Honda intended the Del Sol to be a direct competitor with the Miata but the only thing it has going for it is more interior room because there's no driveline to get to the rear wheels. THEY CALL ME THE RECYCLER BECAUSE I SLAM BOXES. Honda Del Sol: The "Let's just be friends" of cars. The Honda Del Sol taught everybody how to drive Fast and the Furious style even before that movie came out. The redline on this car? 7,200 RPM. And this is the Honda that you slam shift.

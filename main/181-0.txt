It's time for the Corvette C5. The fifth-generation Chevrolet Corvette is the commemorative coin set of automotive investments. C5: for the boomer who buys Jurassic Park collective plates. He has a collection of unused Zippo lighters and a hoarding safe full of silver certificate dollar bills. He loves matinee movies at AMC Theaters. All his sons are married and they all slow danced to Simple Man at their wedding receptions.

 ALL OF THAT rev-popping thumper peacocking has a flashpoint, and it's the Yamaha XT350. The Roman (singing): Single cylinder, four stroke, two carburetors not a slowpoke, slow jet allows for the right a very small hole my fingers don't fit inside it's like last night anniversary forgot the lube, please forgive me, what'dja expect me to do? I didn't know you'd been doin' kegel excercises now your lady wallet's too damn tight. This relationship is over. Mr. Regular: Size matters, yes, of course it does, but size does not matter nearly as much as proportion. The Yamaha XT350 may look small, and it might seem too lean to be of any consequence on the open road, but this air-cooled 349cc thumper has a single cylinder four-stroke engine with double cams that let this motorized trouser snake reach speeds of about 80 miles and hour, granted in excess only really means you can kick this thing up to 83 or maybe 90 an hour if you're going downhill. Right, I have to explain the method of carburetion on this motorcycle. Y'see, the Yamaha XT350 is a single cylinder engine with two carburetors, and here's the thinking behind this: most carburetors have a main jet and a pilot jet. The pilot jet, or sometimes called the idle jet, or sometimes called the slow jet is what keeps the engine running when you're not popping the throttle, sitting there. It's a very small hole, just lets a little bit of fuel in. Your main jet is larger, and that takes care of most of your riding. However, your main jet really doesn't come into use until the needle jet starts pulling out, and that really doesn't happen until about 25% throttle. In fact, if you have an old carbureted bike that just has two jets

My Dad Aeh- and then later your dad comes up, he's like, "Your mother needs- your mother says we have to burn that chair." No seriously, my dad once- he farted a chair up so bad we had to take it out to the burn pile ahahnd- and pour lawnmower gasoline on it and burn it, it got so bad. Urh, but this is a car for rental fleets! Ad- This is a car that's really hard to mess up. I mean, thank you GM for trying to stick with the modern era by putting four cylinders in American cars. I mean, every single dad who's gonna drive this is like, "This drives so well! I can't believe it's a four-cylinder!" Because they grew up in an age where it was either V8 or V6, you know, "V8 if you're a man, V6 if you're the girlfriend." But now everything's four-cylinder. And four-cylinder's fine. That's what this car is. It's fine. (Singing) Dear martinis, I love you a lot.

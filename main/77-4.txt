It's the perfect car for a seven-hour road trip powered solely by podcasts from Corolla Digital. IT'S THE OFFICIAL CAR OF TWO-FISTED HANDJOBS. BANGING INTERNS IN EXECUTIVE WASHROOMS. IT JUST SCREAMS, "I BEAT OFF TO MONEY AND I SAW 'THE WOLF OF WALL STREET' ELEVEN TIMES." That said, it's not as if the Stingray doesn't have its merits.

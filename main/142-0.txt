Virginia Cars and Coffee. UUUUHHH. SO EXTREME. My-my Mustang's a race car. Muh-muh-muh money. Money. Work truck. S2000... Oz wheels. Mustache. Rap. Music. When I come, to Cars and Coffee. I'm a dangerous person. Everybody's filming a steam car. Nice DeLorean. Cars and Coffee. Excuse me. Excuse me. I need to leave. Uh-oh. Not enough people paying attention to me. Gotta rev it. Hello. I'm not Alex Roy. I brought a jib to Cars and Coffee. I'm a graphic designer. Uuunh, more cylinders. Uuunh, more cylinders. My laptop also has a Ferrari badge. I bought this car because I like the children's movie. Back in ti-i-i-me. People taking selfies in front of an F40. A-winga-dinga-dinga-dinga-dinga-dinga-dinga-dinga-dinga pin stripes. Track day, chap! Uh-oh, it's September. Time to put my snowboard rack on my roof. My Mustang is best because dip. All eyes on me. MacGyver. AZNWRR! My entire car is one big uncle joke. Cars and Coffee. Maserati. The Ford Taurus of Manhattan. Cars and Coffee. My girlfriend doesn't wanna be here.

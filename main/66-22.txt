anybody from Chrysler: What I see happening right now is the exact same thing you were doing in the late 1970s. And you can make all the references to the Grumman fighter from WWII you want, but you don't have really good small cars. Yes, you have the Dodge Dart. [Caption: "Of all the names to bring back..."] We said it before, and here it comes again, and I know this is proselytizing, and Iacocca said it himself to Charlie Rose, but if Chrysler wants to come back, if we wanna take you seriously again, you have to start making small cars that Americans want to buy. Because all the heritage and nostalgia in the world doesn't mean a thing if the value of my car bellyflops the second I pull out of the lot.

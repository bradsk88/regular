 Subaru BRZ! The BRZ doesn't have Space Invaders or an XBOX Live account. It does cost more than the Scion and you can still go to Subie meets and all the STI guys'll go, "ONE OF US, ONE OF US, ONE OF US, ONE OF US" But driving a BRZ or FR-S is a reverse Antique Roadshow. Each car comes equipped with a monologue in the form of upholstery seats which rub your shoulders and say, "Oh, isn't this special? Oh yeah, yeah, you hang on to what you got. Yeah, this car'll be worth something someday. Oh it will, it will!" (Caption: This bit here is one long obscure joke for English Major Nerds.) But spin the wheels. Red. Skip the yellow. Green. Girlfriend scared. Cross. She's in the back. Maybe shady. Says to do it no more. Caught eyes with a Veloster. Fate is sealed. Done. A done deal. Hummers are out of sight tonight.

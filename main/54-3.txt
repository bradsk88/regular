 and you pull out gently from a stop, you're not running on your main jet; your slow jet, or idle jet, is propelling the bike. So you can feel when the main jet really starts to kick in, and for most people that's a pleasurable feeling like "okay, NOW we're going". THAT. That's why carburetors are so much fun; there's that, like, two-stage thing when they really come on. But that doesn't really work well when you're doing a lot of slow riding and you're not really taching it up. So the idea here is to have a small carburetor with a small main jet that can come on sooner and give you smooth acceleration. So, a very small carburetor for low speeds, now that's mechanical; the small carburetor is what you control. Then there's a second, larger carburetor that's vacuum-operated. So after a certain point, vacuum valve opens, and the second carburetor kicks in. I know I'm oversimplifying this crazy, only- Yamaha-could-do-this method of fuel delivery, but for the sake of a simple video, this is how that works. Of course there's no point in having two carburetors mounted in tandem. Most modern  carburetors have three jets: slow jet, mid jet, main jet, and that does the exact same thing as having two carburetors, so why Yamaha decided we need two, I

 And yet, I cannot help but offer this counterpoint: It's aged well. It's so horrible, it starts to come around again. It's like an old, beat-up turntable that for some reason you prefer to use over some modern unit. The owner of this car bought it from Florida and brought it here to Pittsburgh. And it fits in with this city so well. He's gonna swap out the engine at some point, sure, but parked up next to modern economy cars, the Dodge Aspen looks...dignified. Because it's not trying to be fast. It's not attempting to be revolutionary. It's like watching old footage from a football team during a rebuilding year; it's nowhere near as painful over 20 years on. The Dodge Aspen makes arriving a victory, and I've never driven a car that was so much fun at 15 miles an hour.

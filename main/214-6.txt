 But what's the point of driving a used police car if no one's gonna give you respect for doing so? It's like putting one of those thin blue line stickers on the back of your car and not getting a nod for it. The Caprice PPV is a lot of fun! I'd like to rent one - not own one - but it's good. Man, this is a nice driving car. But it prices itself right out of its own bracket. I'd rather have one of those new Lincolns that's really a Taurus SHO. Yeah, twin turbo V6. But maybe that's the point of owning a PPV. It's so niche, you can feel special. Because you're gonna be the only one around who has one of these things.

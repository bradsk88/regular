 (FR-S) (Harold Slovinski voice) This is the brand that kids like! Just like a kid, the FR-S is learning about its new kind of feelings and new emotions and teen choices. And this means it has eyes like tear ducts. The owner of this FR-S needed more head unit and more nav. No seriously, Space Invaders. Look, everywhere. It's just- it- have you not noticed this? There's Space Invaders everywhere on this car. This plug senses things. This sticker means something.

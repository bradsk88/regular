 POV DRIVE Mr. Regular: "All right, so here we're going on the highway, and by highway I mean road, but no one's here, so... pulling!" [engine sound] R: "Oh, look at that, it will rev directly to redline." Owner: "Yeah." R: "Nice! All right, geared very nice!" O: "It gets up and goes!" O: "When you come to a stop up there you'll feel kind of going back, I feel it." R: "But when slowing down, this is something that you can- it has that nice, big smooshy area, so... You can smoothly come to a stop for everybody else in the car." O: "Exactly. That's kinda been my goal as a good driver, 'cause I've been in people's cars-" R: "Yeah! They late-brake! And you see those two taillights come up and realize that you're feeling the guy's still accelerating. Like dododododododo- and then, at the last second uuuuuuh." O: "Yeah, I hate that. It's always been day one when I had my apartment." R: "And you have guys who think that, you know, that type of driving is gonna get them... laid... and the're gonna do it so that's OK. So, we gotta turn around here."

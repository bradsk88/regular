 but nevertheless, it's always at the top of every sports car shootout. I mean, who can fault you for owning a Miata? Everyone is happy to see a Miata. I mean, look at it! It's the best! It's the best! It's Number One. It's Number One. It's always Number One. It's the best! It's the best sports car! It's the gleaming gold standard against all which all small sports cars must be measured. Mazda made so many of them that the prices stay low so anyone can own one. And they're the best! They're the best! They're Number One! You drive a Miata because you want the best and you DESERVE the best! Only the best will do! [GROWING INCREASINGLY AGITATED] Wooh, we- we're the best! It's the best sports car! You root for the Yankees! You love the 'Boys! Number One! Y-you get Sam Adams! That's the best beer! That's the best beer! I have the best car! You put on "Dark Side" at every party. But I mean, really? Who's going to complain about Floyd? You make posts commemorating firefighters. I mean, who would DARE downvote that?! Baby photos! Baby photos! Lots of baby photos! Dallas Cowboys! Volunteer firefighters! New York Yankees! BABY PHOTOS!!! Classic rock! Mazda Miata! "My heart goes out to the victims of RRRRRGGGHGHGHGHGHG!!!" THE BEST!!! [SOUND OF THE SCRIPT BEING THROWN ACROSS THE ROOM.]
